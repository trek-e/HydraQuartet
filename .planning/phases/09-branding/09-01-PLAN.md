<objective>
Update plugin.json to rebrand the plugin to "Synth-etic Intelligence" while preserving patch compatibility.

Purpose: Establish proper manufacturer identity in VCV Library for plugin submission while keeping existing patches working.
Output: Updated plugin.json with brand, name, and author fields properly configured.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update plugin.json metadata for branding</name>
  <files>plugin.json</files>
  <action>
Update plugin.json with the following changes:

1. Set `brand` field to "Synth-etic Intelligence" (appears as manufacturer in VCV Library)
2. Set `name` field to "Triax VCO" (plugin collection name)
3. Populate `author` field - ASK USER for their preferred author name before writing

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (from research):
- DO NOT change `slug` field - must remain "HydraQuartet" (patch compatibility)
- DO NOT change module `slug` field - must remain "HydraQuartetVCO" (patch compatibility)

Update module entry:
- Set module `name` to "Triax VCO" (displayed in module browser)
- Keep module `slug` as "HydraQuartetVCO" (DO NOT CHANGE)
- Update `description` if desired
- Remove "Hardware Clone" tag (not applicable for original design)

Final plugin.json structure:
```json
{
  "slug": "HydraQuartet",
  "name": "Triax VCO",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "license": "GPL-3.0-or-later",
  "brand": "Synth-etic Intelligence",
  "author": "[USER PROVIDED]",
  "authorEmail": "",
  "authorUrl": "",
  "pluginUrl": "",
  "manualUrl": "",
  "sourceUrl": "",
  "donateUrl": "",
  "changelogUrl": "",
  "modules": [
    {
      "slug": "HydraQuartetVCO",
      "name": "Triax VCO",
      "description": "8-voice polyphonic dual-VCO with through-zero FM",
      "tags": ["Oscillator", "Polyphonic"]
    }
  ]
}
```

  <verify>
1. Run `cat plugin.json | grep -E '"(slug|brand|name|author)"'` to verify fields
2. Verify slug is still "HydraQuartet" (not changed)
3. Verify brand is "Synth-etic Intelligence"
4. Verify author field is populated (not empty string)
  </verify>
  <done>
- brand field set to "Synth-etic Intelligence"
- name field set to "Triax VCO"
- author field populated with user-provided name
- slug unchanged (remains "HydraQuartet")
- module slug unchanged (remains "HydraQuartetVCO")
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify plugin builds successfully</name>
  <files>None (verification only)</files>
  <action>
Run the build process to verify plugin.json changes don't break anything:

1. Run `make clean` to clear previous build artifacts
2. Run `make` to build the plugin
3. Verify build completes without errors

If build fails, diagnose and fix any issues related to plugin.json format (invalid JSON, missing fields, etc.)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `make clean` completes
2. `make` completes with exit code 0
3. Build output shows no errors related to plugin.json
  </verify>
  <done>
- Plugin builds successfully with updated metadata
- No errors from plugin.json parsing
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Plugin metadata updated for "Synth-etic Intelligence" branding with preserved patch compatibility.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Review plugin.json changes:
   - brand shows "Synth-etic Intelligence"
   - author field is populated with your name
   - slug is still "HydraQuartet" (NOT changed)
   - module slug is still "HydraQuartetVCO" (NOT changed)

2. Test in VCV Rack (optional but recommended):
   - Run `make install`
   - Open VCV Rack
   - Open Module Browser
   - Look for "Synth-etic Intelligence" as manufacturer
   - Verify "Triax VCO" appears as the module name

3. Test patch compatibility (optional):
   - Open any existing patch that uses HydraQuartet VCO
   - Verify it loads correctly (module still recognized)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe any issues with the branding</resume-signal>

1. plugin.json contains brand: "Synth-etic Intelligence"
2. plugin.json contains author: (non-empty string)
3. plugin.json slug unchanged: "HydraQuartet"
4. module slug unchanged: "HydraQuartetVCO"
5. `make` builds successfully

<success_criteria>
- BRAND-01: Plugin branded as "Synth-etic Intelligence" in VCV Library
- BRAND-02: plugin.json updated with correct slug, name, brand fields
- BRAND-04: Folder structure matches VCV plugin requirements (no change needed)
- Note: BRAND-03 (panel SVG update) is optional per research - brand field is sufficient
</success_criteria>
